## About the Project
* "Terms and Conditions" came into being as a result of the necessity to have a clear knowledge of the obligations, rights, and restrictions of parties to a contract or commercial transaction, as well as the usage guidelines and terms that were agreed to as being legally enforceable on both sides.

* This means that the existence of terms and conditions in every contractual relationship is a crucial consideration because it serves as the framework for how the business or contract functions.

# Problem Statement

Businesses spend thousands in legal fees for lack of agreement on core terms at the beginning of the contract. To avoid this, most business contract professionals to draft their terms and conditions, these professionals charge prohibitive fees which are unaffordable for such service. It has however become hard for businesses, especially small and medium scale, to get suitable terms and conditions and privacy policies for their businesses.Â 

Policify aims at reducing the hassles of individuals and Companies of  having to generate privacy policy and or t and c

## Objectives of Policify

* To provide a platform where various industry-specific terms and conditions and privacy policies can be generated.

* To help user's simplify every task needed to generate t&c and privacy policy.

* To absolve users of the huge cost of contracting professionals to draft the terms and conditions and privacy policies

## Details on deployment orunning on local machine

* Git clone
* create a virtual env
* Install all dependencies in requirements.txt
* Make a Postgresql database and give it the information found in settings.py file in the policifyproject directory on the database section.
* if your Postgresql database has different information from the settings. Then update the settings 
* cd into the source folder 
* run python manage.py makemigrations
* run Python manage.py migrate
* run python manage.py collectstatic
* run python manage.py runserver
* if having issue linking static files, then set DEBUG in settings.py in policifyProject to False then run python manage.py runserver --insecure or switch the DEBUG = False  to True and run python manage.py runserver

## Collaboration

Team75 members, follow the following steps to collaborate:

1. Visit the Repository to the Project on Github Website: https://github.com/zuri-training/t_and_c_generator_team75

2. Fork the repository: Click the "Fork" button on the upper right corner of the Repo page.*
3. Make a local clone: 
     Click on the "Code" button on the Repo page <br/>
     Copy the URL for the forked Repo https://github.com/zuri-training/t_and_c_generator_team75.git <br/>
     Create a Folder on your Local machine / Computer for the project Workspace <br/>
     Open Command prompt / Terminal in the same folder location <br/>
     In your Terminal, type: <br/>
        `https://github.com/zuri-training/t_and_c_generator_team75.git`
4. Open terminal and set upstream branch: <br/>
    `https://github.com/zuri-training/t_and_c_generator_team75`
5. Pull upstream to get up to date with the original repo:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
6. Create a new branch for the task you are working on :<br/>
    `git checkout -b branchName`<br/>
    *(Make sure your branchName is descriptive in context to the feature you are working on. Also be sure to check which branch you are on using `git status` before you begin working)*
7. When you're done with your task, do:<br/>
    `git add`<br/>
   - Commit your work with a message:<br/>
   `git commit -m "message"`
8. To avoid conflicts:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
9. Then push your branch:<br/>
    `git push origin branchName` - This creates the branch remotely and pushes to that branch on the Github
10. Go to Github and create a new pull request to the main branch. It will then be reviewed and merged into the master.
