## About the Project
* "Terms and Conditions" came into being as a result of the necessity to have a clear knowledge of the obligations, rights, and restrictions of parties to a contract or commercial transaction, as well as the usage guidelines and terms that were agreed to as being legally enforceable on both sides.

* This means that the existence of terms and conditions in every contractual relationship is a crucial consideration because it serves as the framework for how the business or contract functions.

# Problem Statement

Businesses spend thousands in legal fees for lack of agreement on core terms at the beginning of the contract. To avoid this, most business contract professionals to draft their terms and conditions, these professionals charge prohibitive fees which are unaffordable for such service. It has however become hard for businesses, especially small and medium scale, to get suitable terms and conditions and privacy policies for their businesses.

2. Fork the repository: Click the "Fork" button on the upper right corner of the Repo page.*
3. Make a local clone: 
     Click on the "Code" button on the Repo page <br/>
     Copy the URL for the forked Repo https://github.com/zuri-training/t_and_c_generator_team75.git <br/>
     Create a Folder on your Local machine / Computer for the project Workspace <br/>
     Open Command prompt / Terminal in the same folder location <br/>
     In your Terminal, type: <br/>
        `https://github.com/zuri-training/t_and_c_generator_team75.git`
4. Open terminal and set upstream branch: <br/>
    `https://github.com/zuri-training/t_and_c_generator_team75`
5. Pull upstream to get up to date with the original repo:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
6. Create a new branch for the task you are working on :<br/>
    `git checkout -b branchName`<br/>
    *(Make sure your branchName is descriptive in context to the feature you are working on. Also be sure to check which branch you are on using `git status` before you begin working)*
7. When you're done with your task, do:<br/>
    `git add`<br/>
   - Commit your work with a message:<br/>
   `git commit -m "message"`
8. To avoid conflicts:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
9. Then push your branch:<br/>
    `git push origin branchName` - This creates the branch remotely and pushes to that branch on the Github
10. Go to Github and create a new pull request to the main branch. It will then be reviewed and merged into the master.
